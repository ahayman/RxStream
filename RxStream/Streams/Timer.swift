/**
 A Simple Stream that will emit events every `X` seconds according to the specified interval.
 A Timer stream may either be active or not, without affecting the stream state.
 However, once the stream state is no longer active, the timer will also be terminated.
 
 - note: This uses the default `Foundation.Timer.scheduledTimer`.  
 However, if you need a different kind of Timer (for example, on a different run loop) you can replace the `newTimer` closure to provide the appropriate timer.
 
 - warning: It's important that you provide a proper termination for the stream.  
 Because Foundation.Timer retains it's target, the Timer Stream will remain in memory until the Stream is terminated.
