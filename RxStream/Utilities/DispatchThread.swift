  DispatchThread is a single Thread that processes a queue of work in FIFO order.
  The thread will be kept alive until it's cancelled or the thread is removed from memory.

  In most cases, it would be better to use GCD, Operation Queues or some other abstraction
  instead of creating a DispatchThread.  However, some resources _require_ that all access
  occur through a single thread, and none of the standard concurrency APIs like GCD, NSOperation,
  etc do that (they maintain a flexible pool of threads instead). So DispatchThread is a great
  way to maintain this single-thread access requirement.

  Threads are expensive to create and maintain, which is a large reason why GCD and NSOperation
  are recommended concurrency abstractions.  So it's recommended that you create one and keep it
  around instead of creating and destroying a thread frequently.
