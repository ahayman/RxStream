/**
 This Wraps around `Foundation.Timer` in order to contain the retain cycle inherent in `Foundation.Timer`.  
 It requires an interval and a Handler.  The handler is called whenever the Timer fires and should return whether the timer should continue.
 
 Traditional usage is for the owner to weakly capture `self` and use that as a determinate:
 
 ```
 self.timer = ConditionalTimer(5.0) { [weak self] in
   guard let me = self else { return false }
   // handle the timer fire
   return true
 }
 ```
 
 This makes the lifetime of the ConditionalTimer dependent on it's owner...something that cannot happen with `Foundation.Timer`.
