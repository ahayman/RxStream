   All processing and stream operations will occur on this dispatch.  By default, processing is performed inline, but this can be changed.
   You should be aware of _how_ changing a dispatch queue can affect the order of operations. 
   While all chained operations are guaranteed to be processed serially, changing the dispatch can affect how multiple chains are processed.
   However, since each processor can optionally choose to exhibit asychronous behavior, the below discussion only applies for chains that are serial in nature.
   
   - Using an asynchronous, serial, private queue for performing operations will cause all local processors to process serially, with any downstream processors dispatched back into the queue. This may mean that each "level" of processor may be processed in parallel.
   - Changing this to a synchronous, serial queue will have different behavior:  Each _chain_ will be processed serially.  This means an entire chain will process before the next chain is processed.
   - Changing this to a concurrent queue: Each _chain_ will still be processed serially within itself, but multiple chains will be processed concurrently.  Only use this if you don't care in what order the chains are processed.
   
   - note: This discussion really only applies when you care how multiple chains are processed.  99% of the time you don't need to worry abou it since an individual chain will always process in order and that covers the majority use cases.
   - warning: A dispatch will not forcefully propogate downstream, but it will propogate into newly attached streams. So any existing downsteams won't be affected by changing the dispatch, but any streams attached to this stream after the dispatch is set will.
