/**
  A Progress stream is a type of Future that allows the client to observe the progress of the task while waiting for the task to complete.
  The most obvious and common use case for this is to update a Progress Indicator in the UI while waiting for something to complete/download/process/etc.

  At it's core, the Progress stream replaces the standard two handler function signature with a single return value.  For example, this:

      func downloadImage(at url: URL, progressHandler: ((Progress) -> Void)?, completion: (URL) -> Void)

  can be replaced with:

      func downloadImage(at url: URL) -> Progress<Double, URL>

  The client can then choose to observe the progress on their own terms:

      downloadImage(at: someURL)
         .onProgress{ p in self.updateUIWith(progress: p) }
         .on{ url in self.handleDownloadedImage(at: url) }

  Warning: Unless the Stream is cancelled, the task should _always_ return a result.  Otherwise, both the task and the stream will be leaked in memory.

public class Progress<ProgressUnit, T> : Future<T> {

  /**
    When creating a Progress stream, you'll need to pass in the task closure that both updates the progress _and_ submits the final value when completed.
    The closure takes two arguments:

      - parameter cancelled: a reference Boolean value that indicates whether the task has been cancelled.
        If possible, the task should cancel and clean up.  Any further attempts to call the handler will be ignored.
      - parameter resultHandler: This is an embedded closure that takes either a ProgressEvent or a Result.
        If a progress event is passed in, the stream will be updated with the current progress.  If a Result is passed in,
        the stream will complete with the Result and terminate.
