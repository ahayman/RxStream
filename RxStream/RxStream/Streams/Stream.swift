   All processing and stream operations will occur on this dispatch.  By default, processing is performed inline, but this can be changed.
   You should be aware of _how_ changing a dispatch queue can affect the order of operations. 
   While all chained operations are guaranteed to be processed serially, changing the dispatch can affect how multiple chains are processed.
   However, since each processor can optionally choose to exhibit asychronous behavior, the below discussion only applies for chains that are serial in nature.
   
   - Using an asynchronous, serial, private queue for performing operations will cause all local processors to process serially, with any downstream processors dispatched back into the queue. This may mean that each "level" of processor may be processed in parallel.
   - Changing this to a synchronous, serial queue will have different behavior:  Each _chain_ will be processed serially.  This means an entire chain will process before the next chain is processed.
   - Changing this to a concurrent queue: Each _chain_ will still be processed serially within itself, but multiple chains will be processed concurrently.  Only use this if you don't care in what order the chains are processed.
   
   - note: This discussion really only applies when you care how multiple chains are processed.  99% of the time you don't need to worry abou it since an individual chain will always process in order and that covers the majority use cases.
   - warning: A dispatch will not forcefully propogate downstream, but it will propogate into newly attached streams. So any existing downsteams won't be affected by changing the dispatch, but any streams attached to this stream after the dispatch is set will.

   This is an internal function used to process event work. It's important that all processing work done for a stream use this function.
   The main point of this is to ensure that work is correctly dispatched and throttled.
   It also holds back any termination events until prior work has been completed, preventing a termination event from being processed before a data event is finished.
   How events are processed will depend on what kind of events are called back in the Stream operation:
   
    - `.next(value)` : If the work passes back in next events, those will be processed like normal and pushed down stream like a normal event would. If the triggering event was a termination, it will be processed after the next events are processed.
    - `nil`:  If `nil` is passed back in, no events will be processed, but if the triggering event was a termination, it will be processed like normal.
    - `.termination(reason)` : If a termination event is passed back, it will take priority and _immediately_ be processed and no further events will be accepted.  The termination will progogate both up and down the stream chain.
    - `.error(_)` : Errors will be processed like normal.  However, if the triggering event was a termination, that event will be ignored (the stream will not be terminated).  This effectively converts a termination into an error.  This is primarily used for merged streams, where a termination does not always terminate the stream (because an upstream may still be active).
   
   - parameter key: A key will restrict processing of the event to only those streams that have a matching key stored. If `nil` is passed, the event will be processed as normal.
   - parameter event: The event that should be processed.
   - parameter work: The work processor that should process the event.
   
   - warning: All work for a stream should use this function to process events.
